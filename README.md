## Objectives

This project embarks on an exploratory journey to investigate the effects of Ozempic, a medication primarily used for the treatment of obesity and hypertension, among patients aged 40-75. My research focuses on unraveling causal relationships and estimating the treatment effect of Ozempic, navigating through the challenges of endogeneity to ensure the accuracy of our findings.

## Datasets

- **Medical Claims Data**: This dataset contains detailed records of medical services rendered to the specified patient group, reflecting the complexity and depth of healthcare interactions.

- **Prescription Data**: A focused subset of the Medical Claims dataset, detailing the prescriptions dispensed, which provides a closer look at the medication regimen followed by the patients.

## Project Methodology

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: An in-depth examination of the datasets to understand the structure, uncover patterns, and identify anomalies. This phase involves generating visualizations to explore variable distributions and relationships.

- **Data Preprocessing and Merging**: Meticulous preparation of the datasets for analysis, addressing missing data, encoding categorical variables, and merging datasets to form a coherent structure for advanced analysis.

- **Causal Analysis Setup**: Addressing the potential endogeneity issues to accurately estimate the treatment effect of Ozempic. This involves strategizing around the challenges of causality and treatment effect estimation, drawing on the theoretical frameworks discussed in the literature.

- **Model Development**: Implementing the double-lasso technique to estimate the treatment effect, taking into account the endogeneity of treatment assignment. This phase also involves justifying the selection of variables for the model.

- **Model Evaluation and Interpretation**: Assessing the model's performance and discussing the implications of the findings. This includes interpreting the estimated treatment effects and their impact on the target patient population.

- **Additional Insights**: Incorporating demographic factors and additional Ozempic-related information to enrich the analysis, exploring the influence of these factors on treatment effects and patterns of Ozempic use.

## Contributions

This project is an independent endeavor aimed at contributing to the understanding of Ozempic's impact in the medical field, particularly for obese and hypertensive patients. Insights derived from this analysis could inform healthcare professionals, policymakers, and researchers about the nuances of medication effects within this demographic.
